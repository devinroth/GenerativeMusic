# GenerativeMusic

License: GNU General Public License v3.0. Free to use for open source projects. 

The goal of this project is to create generative music based on specific style using Swift Playground on macOS.

For this project the algorithms produce a midi output which is routed to Kontakt and played back with virtual instruments. I view each algorithm as a separate musical work. 

## JazzCycle

JazzCycle follows a common jazz improvisation exersice on the circle of fifths.

## Moonlight

Inspired by Beethoven's Moonlight Sonata, this algorithm creates a lyrical melody accompianed by randomly generated broken chords.
